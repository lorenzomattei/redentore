# Politics and the English Language
Essay about the importance of language in politics. 
*'Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and*
*deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended,*
*but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do*
*not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has*
*to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.*
*Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the*
*countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets:*
*this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent*
*trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of*
*population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or*
*shot in the back of the neck: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such*
*phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures*
*of them.'*
It's all a matter of *perception* and *image*. Actions are often overlooked. 
### Linguistic clichés[^2] 
1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
2. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
3. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
4. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
# Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949)
Warning of something that is already happening, dystopian novel. 
![[1984|Societal Pyramid]]

The Ministry of Love enforces the law
The Ministry of Plenty takes care of the economy
The Ministry of Peace takes care of warfare
The Ministry of Truth manages media and circulation of information -> Memory Hole[^1]

The Party created a new language, which is called newspeak. The principles are the same of Orwell's linguistic cliches. The less words people know, the better: they will be more easily manipulated.

Doublethink is a skill that the Party wants people to develop: the ability to take something for true, but at the same time taking the complete opposite for true. 

Slogans:
1. War is Peace = the party, by fighting an outer enemy, keeps the peace inside the State;
2. Freedom is slavery = before the regime, there was freedom too, now there is freedom from. The Party protects the people from the risks connected with freedom;
3. Ignorance is strength = by not knowing anything, there is nothing to be worried about: the Party will take care of every aspect of their life.
